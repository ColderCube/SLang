# SLang
This project aims to create a platform independent programming language. It was started when I was making Os using BIOS. It does not use any library functions except for memory allocations.
It is by far not a good code example you could find and it is extremely messy as it was made by thinking of the c++ classes so, be warned.
It is currently under development so it is been hardcoded to uses the file in same directory.


#NOTE
This is by far not the best code you could learn from if you are trying to learn start by using antlr4 or lex/bison.
